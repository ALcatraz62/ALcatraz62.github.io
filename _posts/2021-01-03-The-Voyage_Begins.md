A new year and thus a new project. While I usually find myself being more of a Star Wars guy then Star Trek as far as storylines goes. There are still some cool ship designs from the Star Trek series.  Personally I remembering watched Star Trek Voyager when I was a kid. It's the first Star Trek series that I really watched as it aired and followed closely. So this is a project that I am really looking forward to. I really hope to bring this kit to life and put my own spin on it. 

 This is the largest model I have tried to tackle and it's going to be plenty of learn by doing moments. I have already viewed a number of other build blog posts and YouTube videos which I will reference as they come up.  I hope to combine the learning from these to help make my own unique version.  The model kit I am using is the Revell U.S.S Voyager (kit number 04992).![Revell U.S.S Voyager](/images/Voyager/RevellVoyager.jpg)  Along with that kit, I have also purchased the Para Graphix U.S.S Voyager Photoetch Set. I never used photoetch before, but the idea is to use these metal pieces to replace/add to the existing molded plastic to add more detail. In addition I've seen others use simple styrene to add some missing details that doesn't seem too hard to do so I will give that a whirl as well. ![ParaGraphix](/images/Voyager/ParaGraphixVoyager.jpg)
 
 The real fun part of this for me will be the electronics I think these will really kick the model up a few notches.  The pictures and videos I've seen of a lit voyager really is what makes me excited (and a little nervous) to build this project.  I've done some simple lighting of an X-Wing model and a Ironman Arc reactor so I think this is the next step.  The plan is to use an arduino to manage the lights and allow for animations and maybe even work some sound effects.  I seen some videos about arduino mp3 players so I think that won't be too bad.  The real stretch goal will be if I can get the nacelles to move. I feel like it could be done with a little servo pulling some wire that is attached to the interior of each nacelle. I've only come across one video of someone doing it so not sure how realistic it will be for me to pull it off. I'm gonna give it awhirl though and if I can pull it off I think it will be really cool.   

### Hopeful Features ###

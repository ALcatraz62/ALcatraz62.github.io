SpiralForge Blog is up and running. The goal of this place is simple, to document my tinkering work in a centralized place for me and prehaps others to reference and enjoy.  I have a tendency to start projects and not always finish, so maybe by tracking my efforts, it will help things get to a solid finish.  As I work on things,  I will post my various notes and decisions here.  Hopefully this is truely the first of many posts here.

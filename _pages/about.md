I built this site as a way to keep track of my random tinker projects that I play with.  I have a habit of finding new interesting things I want to try to make or develop but rarely find the time to stick with them to the end of the project.  I hope by tracking things as I go it might help accomplish these projects...or this too will be another abandoned tinker project, only time will tell on that one.  At the very least this place can serve as a repo of notes and learnings as I go along which will certainly help me and perhaps others too.
## Things I seem to play with include any combo of:
* Coding
* Arduino (Embedded electronics in general)
* 3D Printing
* Scale Model Building

### This site is built with Reverie
[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features.  I copied it to my own repo and have made changes on top of it.
Learn more about it [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) on how to get started.
